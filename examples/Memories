Memories are the built-in array type for our DSL,
which correspond to any physical memories such as SRAM OR
black box circuits with a memory interface (e.g. some caches)

Memory Types are written as such:

elemType[addrSize]

where elemType is some non-memory type,
and addrSize is a constant of unsigned integer type //TODO support statically evaluatable expressions
which denotes how many bits are required to address the memory.
A memory with addrSize = a, can store 2^a elements.

This corresponds to the following information about a memory:

Memory: {
  readOut: elemType
  writeInt: elemType
  addressType: int<addrSize>
}
